- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @code2107
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the R programming language and the basics of GitHub to help me analyse data in my Marine Science course at university.
- ðŸ‘€ I am fascinated by the various physical, chemical and biological processes that occur within Earth's oceans. I am also passionate about making our world a better place to live in; whether that be by uplifting others, protecting the environment, personal development or simply by fascilitating tasks or creating art.
